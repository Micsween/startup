>  This is a template for your startup application. You must modify this `README.md` file for each phase of your development. You only need to fill in the section for each deliverable when that deliverable is submitted in Canvas. Without completing the section for a deliverable, the TA will not know what to look for when grading your submission. Feel free to add additional information to each deliverable description, but make sure you at least have the list of rubric items and a description of what you did for each item.

## ðŸš€ AWS deliverable

This was relatively easy. Although, I made a mistake in picking BYUno as my domain name. It would've been much easier to pick a more generic name that I could then  use it for another programming project! But I still will. It'd be nice to use it as part of my resume.

- [x] **Server deployed and accessible with custom domain name** - [Byuno.click](https://startup.byuno.click/).

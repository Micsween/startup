### Key features

- Create and play a Game of UNO
- Login
- Create an account
- Ability to click and drag cards
- View match history

### Technologies

I am going to use the required technologies in the following ways.

- **HTML** - Basic elements, creates the structure of each page.
- **CSS** - Basic movement of the cards, makes everything look nice
- **React** - Allows for page navigation and creating components for easy re-use, such as the player profiles displayed in-game, players can click and drag cards.
- **Service** - Saves the result of each match to each player's profile
- **Authentication** - A user can log in and view their match history/create a game.
- **DB/Login** - the Match history page
- **WebSocket** - game end updates match history, players play their cards in real-time

## ðŸš€ AWS deliverable

This was relatively easy. Although, I made a mistake in picking BYUno as my domain name. It would've been much easier to pick a more generic name that I could then  use it for another programming project! But I still will. It'd be nice to use it as part of my resume.

- [x] **Server deployed and accessible with custom domain name** - [Byuno.click](https://startup.byuno.click/).

## ðŸš€ HTML deliverable

For this deliverable I did the following. I checked the box `[x]` and added a description for things I completed.
Examining Simon HTML I more fully understood how the canvas tag works. I also liked that you could tell the page to conform to the width of a device. Seeing a structural version of Simon made me think of how I could display some of my project's features in a way that is easy for playtesting. Such as "X created a game." I believe that will be very useful.

I found out that buttons can submit a get() request to a specific url. I implemented that in the join game page.

I realized that in my initial design, the need to have an entire page dedicated to just navigating to other pages seemed kind of redundant. So I decided to keep the design of using a navbar throughout the entire application, and make the default log-in page your match history. Which is blank, if the profile is new.


- [x] **HTML pages** I decided to make less elements to navigate to and break down what each page does to avoid redundance.
- [x] **Proper HTML element usage** - I think I've learned I should add more divs.
- [x] **Links** - linking the buttons to their respective pages was convenient and made the pages feel cooler.
- [x] **Text** - Lots of filler text
- [x] **3rd party API placeholder** - Im going to put inspirational quotes in the match history page.
- [x] **Images** - I think I'll have 4 default profile pictures that are randomly assigned when a match starts.
- [x] **Login placeholder** - I have a forgot password placeholder which Ive decided i will implement if I have some extra time.
- [x] **DB data placeholder** - my website is going to store the history of a player's games
- [x] **WebSocket placeholder** - You'll see cards being played in real time.

You only need to fill in the section for each deliverable when that deliverable is submitted in Canvas. Without completing the section for a deliverable, the TA will not know what to look for when grading your submission. Feel free to add additional information to each deliverable description, but make sure you at least have the list of rubric items and a description of what you did for each item.

### Key features

- Create and play a Game of UNO
- Login
- Create an account
- Ability to click and drag cards
- View match history

### Technologies

I am going to use the required technologies in the following ways.

- **HTML** - Basic elements, creates the structure of each page.
- **CSS** - Basic movement of the cards, makes everything look nice
- **React** - Allows for page navigation and creating components for easy re-use, such as the player profiles displayed in-game, players can click and drag cards.
- **Service** - Saves the result of each match to each player's profile
- **Authentication** - A user can log in and view their match history/create a game.
- **DB/Login** - the Match history page
- **WebSocket** - game end updates match history, players play their cards in real-time

## ðŸš€ AWS deliverable

This was relatively easy. Although, I made a mistake in picking BYUno as my domain name. It would've been much easier to pick a more generic name that I could then  use it for another programming project! But I still will. It'd be nice to use it as part of my resume.

- [x] **Server deployed and accessible with custom domain name** - [Byuno.click](https://startup.byuno.click/).

## ðŸš€ HTML deliverable

For this deliverable I did the following. I checked the box `[x]` and added a description for things I completed.
Examining Simon HTML I more fully understood how the canvas tag works. I also liked that you could tell the page to conform to the width of a device. Seeing a structural version of Simon made me think of how I could display some of my project's features in a way that is easy for playtesting. Such as "X created a game." I believe that will be very useful.

I found out that buttons can submit a get() request to a specific url. I implemented that in the join game page.

I realized that in my initial design, the need to have an entire page dedicated to just navigating to other pages seemed kind of redundant. So I decided to keep the design of using a navbar throughout the entire application, and make the default log-in page your match history. Which is blank, if the profile is new.


- [x] **HTML pages** I decided to make less elements to navigate to and break down what each page does to avoid redundance.
- [x] **Proper HTML element usage** - I think I've learned I should add more divs.
- [x] **Links** - linking the buttons to their respective pages was convenient and made the pages feel cooler.
- [x] **Text** - Lots of filler text
- [x] **3rd party API placeholder** - Im going to put inspirational quotes in the match history page.
- [x] **Images** - I think I'll have 4 default profile pictures that are randomly assigned when a match starts.
- [x] **Login placeholder** - I have a forgot password placeholder which Ive decided i will implement if I have some extra time.
- [x] **DB data placeholder** - my website is going to store the history of a player's games
- [x] **WebSocket placeholder** - You'll see cards being played in real time.

## ðŸš€ CSS deliverable

Reading through simon-css I discovered this line of code:
```
main {
      flex: 1 calc(100vh - 110px);
}
```
There were several other things included in the styling for the 'main' tag, but it caught my eye that if I deactivated this in the debugger it caused the whole body to shorten to the size of its content. This would solve a problem I had with my own code! Now I just had to research what calc(100vh - 110px) meant..
After messing around with it a bit, I figured it out! 100vh means take up 100% of the viewport height, minus 110px (the size of the footer!).
- [x] **Header, footer, and main content body** - This part was relatively simple. 
- [x] **Navigation elements** - I liked making it look pretty and added a collapsable header if the window is to small.
- [x] **Responsive to window resizing** - it's responsive to an extent. theres a point where it would be too hard to see the objects if they got too much smaller, so I didn't add that.
- [x] **Application elements** - Lots of tables! The game page took me the most amount of time.
- [x] **Application text content** - This didn't take too long.
- [x] **Application images** - I started with a few placeholder images.

## ðŸš€ React part 1: Routing deliverable
> [!IMPORTANT] 
> So make sure you include node_modules in your .gitignore file.

- [x] **Bundled using Vite** - This was relatively easy! Vite was very easy to install.
- [x] **Components** - I made all the components. I had some difficulty with the css because I had some id's with the same name. which
- [x] **Router** - Routers are so nice! The website loads so much smoother now.

## ðŸš€ React part 2: Reactivity

For this deliverable I did the following. I checked the box `[x]` and added a description for things I completed.

- [x] **All functionality implemented or mocked out** Yes! I wrote a server.js file to simulate what it will look like when I have a server
- [x] **Hooks** I used useEffect to update the components as needed.

## ðŸš€ Service deliverable

For this deliverable I did the following. I checked the box `[x]` and added a description for things I completed.

- [x] **Node.js/Express HTTP service** - Node.js was very easy to implement.
- [x] **Static middleware for frontend** - I added middleware for my "public" directory
- [x] **Calls to third party endpoints** - I added an inspirational quote api to my matchHistory page
- [x] **Backend service endpoints** - I added endpoints for all current functionality.
- [x] **Frontend calls service endpoints** - I added a client.js file that makes all the calls to the service endpoints.

## ðŸš€ DB/Login deliverable

For this deliverable I did the following. I checked the box `[x]` and added a description for things I completed.
My goal for this deliverable is to use connection pooling! 
- [x] **User registration** - Super easy. Also super fun
- [x] **User login and logout** - Added an authtoken that was saved in the database and set to null when a user logs out
- [x] **Stores data in MongoDB** - I had way too many problems with  this but I got it working.
- [x] **Stores credentials in MongoDB** - Yep
- [x] **Restricts functionality based on authentication** -You can't access other pages if you're not logged in.

## ðŸš€ WebSocket deliverable

For this deliverable I did the following. I checked the box `[x]` and added a description for things I completed.

- [x] **Backend listens for WebSocket connection** - I used socket.io, which is a library for websocket.
- [x] **Frontend makes WebSocket connection** - Using socket.io made making rooms so much easier.
- [x] **Data sent over WebSocket connection** -This was actually so fun. I loved this part.
- [x] **WebSocket data displayed** - Playing cards updates in real-time, and so does the number of players in a game.
- [x] **Application is fully functional** - Yep! Now you can play uno with your friends! Yay!

## AWS Notes
From : [Amazon Web Services tutorial](https://github.com/webprogramming260/.github/blob/main/profile/webServers/amazonWebServicesEc2/amazonWebServicesEc2.md)
<!-- I don't quite understand this yet so I'm going to save it for later.-->
The Caddyfile is the configuration file for your web service gateway. The public_html directory contains all of the static files that you are serving up directly through Caddy when using it as a web service. We will cover Caddy configuration in a later instruction. The services directory is the place where you are going to install all of your web services once you build them.

## Accessing the server remotely
look to google slides from 1/16/24 to set up domain name and restart

```sh
âžœ  ssh -i [key pair file] ubuntu@[ip address]
```
## CADDY NOTES
- **Configuration file**: `~/Caddyfile`
  This file contains the definitions for routing HTTP requests that Caddy receives. It also determines what files to use based on the domain name given.
- **HTML Files**: `~/Caddyfile`
  Okay, so: your website is in a directory. And you can specify what directory to open when there's an HTTP request!! That's what this file is for
```
  80 IS THE PORT FOR HTTP REQUESTS SO THATS WHY IT SAYS :80 
  :80 {
        root * /usr/share/caddy
        file_server
  }
```
## What is a port number?
A port number is a way to identify a process to which a network message is to be forwarded when it arrives at a server. Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) messages always go to port 80 -- one of the most commonly used ports.

>Don't forget!!
Note that your elastic IP address is allocated until your release it, not until you terminate your instance. So make sure you release it when you no longer need it. Otherwise you will get a nasty $3 bill every month.

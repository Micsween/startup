## AWS Notes
From : [Amazon Web Services tutorial](https://github.com/webprogramming260/.github/blob/main/profile/webServers/amazonWebServicesEc2/amazonWebServicesEc2.md)
<!-- I don't quite understand this yet so I'm going to save it for later.-->
The Caddyfile is the configuration file for your web service gateway. The public_html directory contains all of the static files that you are serving up directly through Caddy when using it as a web service. We will cover Caddy configuration in a later instruction. The services directory is the place where you are going to install all of your web services once you build them.

## Accessing the server remotely
look to google slides from 1/16/24 to set up domain name and restart

```sh
âžœ  ssh -i [key pair file] ubuntu@[ip address]
```
>[!NOTE]
> MY WEBSITE IP: http://34.228.83.158/

>[!IMPORTANT]
>Don't forget!!
Note that your elastic IP address is allocated until your release it, not until you terminate your instance. So make sure you release it when you no longer need it. Otherwise you will get a nasty $3 bill every month.

The layers of the internet
